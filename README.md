# Text2MindMap
An online tool for making mindmaps by writing indented lists.
This in its current state is basically just a quick mashup between some of the code from the [original site](http://www.text2mindmap.com) and some code from [@tobloef](https://github.com/tobloef)'s [Markdown Editor](https://tobloef.com/markant/), all done by him.
